# Pokemon Game

This is a fun little game that I made from object oriented programming. 
The win condition of the game is to collect a certain amount of moving pokemon.
You can click with your cursor to create a world changing event. In this case,
the click spawns a munchlax that travels to other pokemon using A-Star pathing and 
evolves them.

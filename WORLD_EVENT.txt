1. How To Trigger The Event
    A mouse click will cause a master rare candy chef to spawn. Around him, he spawns a ring or "aura" of delicious rare candies which are munchlax's favorite treats.

2. What Should Happen When The Event Is Triggered
    When the rare candy chef spawns, he turns the closest bulbasaur into a venusaur for a short period of time.
    He can't affect a charizard because charizard doesn't have anymore evolutions left (unless you're counting mega-evolution but you would need a mega stone to do that :))

3. What The Affected Entities Should Do
    Because bulbasaur ate so much rare candies to evolve, as a venusaur, he is so full and sleepy that he moves super slow for a short amount of time.
    The effects of the candy eventually wear off and venusaur turns back into a bulbasaur. Munchlax is given a candy(his favorite food!); he stops crying
     and evolves into a snorlax permanently. He continues to sleep in the same place and no longer animates.

4. What The New Entity Is And How It Should Behave
   The rare candy chef notices that munchlax is causing a tantrum and walks to calm him down by feeding him some delicious rare candies. Chef follows Astar pathing
   to reach the closest munchlax and make it evolve. The chef can only walk 30 tiles before he gets tired and leaves the game, waiting for the next mouseclick to
   call him back into the game.

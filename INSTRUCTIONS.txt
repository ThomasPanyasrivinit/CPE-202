SIDE NOTES

2. I originally just did the basic project 3 requirements and wasn't going for the extra credit. BUT because we're presenting
our projects, I wanted to make my project a little more interesting to present. I haven't implemented another pathing algorithm
other than ASTAR and Single Step or made a video to explain this game because I am not going for extra credit. Thank you!
